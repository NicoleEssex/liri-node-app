# liri-node-app
NodeJS Project
Liri is a node application that will search and retrieve tweets, songs, and movie data from three different api's. It takes in the requests using Inquirer. If you answer the first question with, spotify-this-song, or, movie-this, it will then ask you another question and have you specify what song or movie you wish to find information for. If you answer the first question with, my-tweets, it will return 20 tweets.
